\usage{
rc.ramclustr(
  ramclustObj = NULL,
  st = NULL,
  sr = NULL,
  maxt = NULL,
  deepSplit = FALSE,
  blocksize = 2000,
  mult = 5,
  hmax = NULL,
  collapse = TRUE,
  minModuleSize = 2,
  linkage = "average",
  cor.method = "pearson",
  cor.use = "pairwise.complete.obs",
  rt.only.low.n = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ramclustObj}{ramclustR object: containing ungrouped features.  constructed by rc.get.xcms.data, for example}

\item{st}{numeric: sigma t - time similarity decay value}

\item{sr}{numeric: sigma r - correlational similarity decay value}

\item{maxt}{numeric: maximum time difference to calculate retention similarity for - all values beyond this are assigned similarity of zero}

\item{deepSplit}{logical: controls how agressively the HCA tree is cut - see ?cutreeDynamicTree}

\item{blocksize}{integer: number of features (scans?) processed in one block  =1000,}

\item{mult}{numeric: internal value, can be used to influence processing speed/ram usage}

\item{hmax}{numeric: precut the tree at this height, default 0.3 - see ?cutreeDynamicTree}

\item{collapse}{logical: if true (default), feature quantitative values are collapsed into spectra quantitative values.}

\item{minModuleSize}{integer: how many features must be part of a cluster to be returned? default = 2}

\item{linkage}{character: heirarchical clustering linkage method - see ?hclust}

\item{cor.method}{character: which correlational method used to calculate 'r' - see ?cor 'method' option. default = "pearson"}

\item{cor.use}{character: which data points to use to calculate 'r' - see ?cor 'use' option. default = "pairwise.complete.obs"}

\item{rt.only.low.n}{logical: default = TRUE  At low injection numbers, correlational relationships of peak intensities may be unreliable.  by defualt ramclustR will simply ignore the correlational r value and cluster on retention time alone.  if you wish to use correlation with at n < 5, set this value to FALSE.}
}
\value{
$featclus: integer vector of cluster membership for each feature

$clrt: cluster retention time

$clrtsd: retention time standard deviation of all the features that comprise that cluster

$nfeat: number of features in the cluster

$nsing: number of 'singletons' - that is the number of features which clustered with no other feature

$cmpd: compound name.  C#### are assigned in order of output by dynamicTreeCut.  Compound with the most features is classified as C0001...

$ann: annotation.  By default, annotation names are identical to 'cmpd' names.  This slot is a placeholder for when annotations are provided

$SpecAbund: the cluster intensities after collapsing features to clusters

$SpecAbundAve: the cluster intensities after averaging all samples with identical sample names

\description{
Main clustering function for grouping features based on their analytical behavior.
}
\details{
Main clustering function output - see citation for algorithm description or vignette('RAMClustR') for a walk through.  batch.qc. normalization requires input of three vectors (1) batch (2) order (3) qc.   This is a feature centric normalization approach which adjusts signal intensities first by comparing batch median intensity of each feature (one feature at a time) QC signal intensity to full dataset median to correct for systematic batch effects and then secondly to apply a local QC median vs global median sample correction to correct for run order effects.
